A:  All  right,   people. We're  holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales, and we need to do it NOW! I want concrete solutions. How do you intend to drive sales...  Roger?

B:  Well, in fact,  we're the most expensive in the market,   so maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors?

A:  Lower our prices? Not very creative. It'll never fly  with Swan. What kind of thinking is that? Geez. Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie?

C:  Um, perhaps, um, a sales promotion.   Maybe a two-for-one offer,  or something like that!

A:  What? That's the same thing. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think!  The CEO will be here any minute.

D:  Do we have any ideas yet?

C:  Yes Mr.  Swan,  we were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive.

D:  A two-for-one promotion?  Hmm. I kind of like the sound of that. It sounds like something we should consider.

A:  Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking!  In fact,   that's a brilliant idea!  I'm glad we thought of that. Very creative.
