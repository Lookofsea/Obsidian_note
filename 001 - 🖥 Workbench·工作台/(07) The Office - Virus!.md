A: Oh great! This stupid computer froze again! That’s the third time today! Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC? It’s **acting up** again. It must have a virus or something.  
B: Just give me a second; I’ll be right up.  
B: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files!  
A: But I’m quite careful when I’m browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.  
B: Well, you have to make sure that your **anti-virus software** is updated regularly; yours wasn't up to date, that's probably what was causing your problems.  
A: Ok. Anything else?  
B: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer!  
A: Um yeah… Sorry about that.
