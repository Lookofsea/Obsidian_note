A:  This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O'Connell  reporting  live from Washington,   D. C. where a  protest    has broken out.  Thousands of  angry citizens are protesting  against the  proposed bailout of  the auto manufacturing industry!   Sir,  sir,  Sar

B:  Yeah,  yeah,  we  are  here  because  we  feel  this  is  an  injustice!   The  financial **irresponsibility** of  big business has to stop!    We're  here   to show  the   government that  we  don't   like  the  way  that  they're  spending    our  tax dolla

A:  Sir,  but  what exactly   is making  everyone so  angry?

B:  It's  an  absolute  **outrage**,   Sarah,  the  US government  wants to give twenty-five billion  dollars of  taxpayers' money to  the  auto industry.  These are companies that  have been mismanaged and  are  now nearly bankrupt.

A:  I see.   But,  many supporters of  the bailout argue  that  it  could  help save  the  jobs of  millions of  hardworking Americans.

B:  That may be  true,  and I for one don't  want  to see  anyone  lose their  job,  but  how can these  CEOs ask  for  a  bailout when  they're  making  millions of  dollars?    And  then they have the nerve  to fly  to  Washington   in  private  jets!  This

A:  Good point.   This  is  Sarah O'Connell  reporting  live  from  Washington D. C.,  back to  you,   Tom.
