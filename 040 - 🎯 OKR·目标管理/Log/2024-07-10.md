### 今日复习

你好，我是人类社会与巫师协会的联络人。经过整整一年的考察，您已经成功通过霍格沃兹的地球社会观察实验，我们发现您有潜力成为一名真正的巫师。由于您在生活中展示出的认真与耐心，您将被直接录取到赫奇帕奇学院。如果您有意愿来霍格沃兹，附件是您的入学通知信和一张能在任何时间通往霍格沃兹的车票，不过我个人认为您首要的任务是如何到达伦敦**国王十字车站**的**9¾**站台。顺便一提，我没有魔法并且有些懒惰，入学信是一份复制，它来自大名鼎鼎的巫师——哈利波特。我希望你能有办法把所有与波特有关的词语替换成自己的名字，别忘了你可是一名潜在的巫师。最后，生日快乐，希望你能享受这份喜悦。

## 今天写点啥？
Dear MS. DEANA
 Hello, I am the liaison between the Humane Society and the Wizards' Guild, and sometimes wizards find ways to recruit students with extra talent. After a full year of scrutiny, you have successfully passed the Earth Society Observation Experiment at Hogwarts, and we have found that you have the potential to become a true wizard. Given the conscientiousness and patience you have shown in your life, you will be admitted directly to Hufflepuff House. Enclosed you will find your admission letter and a ticket that will allow you to arrive at Hogwarts at any time of the day or night if you wish to come. However, I personally believe that your first priority is how to get to platform **9¾** at King's Cross Station in London. By the way, I'm not magical and a bit lazy, so the admission letter is a copy, from the great wizard Harry Potter. I hope you have the means to replace all the Potter-related words with your own name, don't forget you're a potential wizard. Finally, happy birthday and I hope you enjoy this pleasure from Hogwarts.
