## 对话

### 美食总动员
I think it's apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit. What's the problem?
First of all, I am a rat , Whick means life is hard, and second ，I have a highly developed sense of taste and smell .
- Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean small twist of lemon
- you can smell all that？you have a gift
- This is emile , my brother. He's easily impressed.
- so you can smell ingredients?
- He also happens to be the leader of our clan.
- so what's wrong with having highly developed senses?
### 紫罗兰永恒花园
- I've been in the hospital for 120 days now. My strength has almost recovered.
The movement is still a little difficult, but i can perform my duties. Please let me return to my post soon.
